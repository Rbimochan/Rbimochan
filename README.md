## Overview

I design and build **end-to-end intelligent systems**—from data pipelines and backend architecture to applied machine learning models and research-backed prototypes.

My work sits at the intersection of:

* Software engineering
* Applied machine learning
* Systems thinking
* Research-to-production workflows

I optimize for **long-term capability**, not short-term visibility.

---

## Core Focus

In practice, I:

* Build production-grade backend systems and APIs
* Design ML pipelines from raw data → inference → application
* Apply statistical learning to real-world, noisy domains (especially healthcare)
* Translate research ideas into deployable, constrained systems

I routinely bridge roles that are often siloed:

> *System engineer × ML engineer × data scientist*

## Technical Stack (Condensed)

**Backend & Systems**

* Node.js, Express
* MongoDB
* Python: Django, FastAPI
* API-first design, authentication, scalability considerations

**Data & Machine Learning**

* Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
* Scikit-learn
* Regression (linear & non-linear), classification
* Feature engineering, validation, model evaluation

---

## Engineering Philosophy

I work from first principles:

* **Data before models**
* **Systems before frameworks**
* **Understanding before optimization**
* **Research before scaling**

This keeps my work adaptable across domains and resilient to tooling churn.

## Flagship Work (In Progress)

### AI-Assisted Blood Sample Analysis System

A research-driven system focused on:

* Blood glucose prediction
* Non-linear statistical modeling
* Reliable inference under noisy, real-world data

Initial experimental validations show **~X–Y% improvement over baseline statistical predictors** under controlled conditions.
The system is architected to evolve from experimentation to **clinically relevant deployment**, not as a demo artifact.

---

## Research Orientation

I approach AI as a **scientific discipline**, not a feature set.

Current interests include:

* Predictive healthcare analytics
* Applied statistical learning
* Model reliability and interpretability
* Translating mathematical assumptions into operational systems

My long-term trajectory includes PhD-level research in **AI / Computational Intelligence**, with emphasis on original contribution and practical relevance.

## Systems-Scale Thinking

In parallel with ML systems, I explore **infrastructure-level problems**, including feasibility work on improving digital connectivity in Nepal. This reflects the same systems mindset: constraints, incentives, reliability, and long-term impact.

---

## What I’m Open To

* AI / ML engineering roles
* Research collaborations
* System design problems with real constraints
* Work that compounds over years, not quarters

---

## Closing

I’m not optimizing for visibility.
I’m optimizing for **depth, leverage, and durability**.

If you value:

* Systems thinking
* Research-backed engineering
* Quiet execution over loud claims
